## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates practical use of NumPy for structured data analysis using a fictional smokehouse restaurant dataset. The objective was to convert raw Python lists into NumPy arrays, combine them into a structured dataset, and compute revenue metrics using vectorized operations.

This project reinforces foundational data manipulation techniques that are critical in data analytics, AI engineering, and backend development.
