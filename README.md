## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates practical use of NumPy for structured data analysis using a fictional smokehouse restaurant dataset. The objective was to convert raw Python lists into NumPy arrays, combine them into a structured dataset, and compute revenue metrics using vectorized operations.

This project reinforces foundational data manipulation techniques that are critical in data analytics, AI engineering, and backend development.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Converting Python lists into NumPy arrays
- Inspecting array structure (`shape`, `ndim`, `dtype`)
- Stacking arrays into multidimensional datasets
- Vectorized mathematical operations
- Type casting with `.astype()`
- Appending calculated columns using `np.column_stack()`
- Basic revenue analysis logic

---

## 📊 Dataset Structure

The dataset contains:

- Menu Item Name  
- Item Price  
- Quantity Sold

## 💡 Why This Project Matters

Understanding NumPy vectorization is essential because:

- It improves performance compared to Python loops
- It mirrors real-world data workflows
- It builds foundational knowledge for Pandas, Machine Learning, and AI systems

This project demonstrates structured thinking in data modeling and computational efficiency.
